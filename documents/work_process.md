# Workflow and GitHub Development Process

## Group Meetings
Every week on Monday right after our previous meeting for a restropective and debriefing on our previous tasks.


The purpose of this meeting: 
- Discuss and reach consensus on major decisions 
- Create new tasks

A second week meeting will occur if necessary

## Group Communication Channel
* **Teams**: weekly or bi-weekly meetings
* **GitHub**: For task-related issues
* **Telegram**: Informal discussion

## GitHub Project

This is our primary project management tool. 

This allows us to monitor and track who's working on what and the status of the tasks

All work tasks and items are tracked via GitHub issues.

Group members self-assigns or are assigned task after preliminary discussion.

All new features must be implemented in a new branch from the main branch and can only be implemented via pull request
after the reviews of another group member.

Direct commits on the main branch are only allowed for the following actions:
- Minor formatting change with whitespaces and indentations
- Typos fixes on documentations and comments


### Status
- **Todo**: New issues that are not yet assigned and worked on
- **In progress**: Task that are currently being worked on
- **In reviews**: Pull request relating to the task is created and is awaiting reviews
- **Done**: Completed task

### Creating Issue
All issues are related to a task to be achieved


### Branch naming convention
```markdown
