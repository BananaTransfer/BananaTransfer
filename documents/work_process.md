## Development Workflow

### GitHub Project Management

We use **GitHub Projects** as our primary project management tool with the following structure:

#### Issue Status Flow
```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done
```

- **Backlog**: New ideas, future features, not yet prioritized
- **Todo**: Prioritized items ready for development
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on (assign yourself)
- **In Review**: Pull request created, awaiting code review
- **Done**: Completed and merged to main branch

#### Task Assignment
1. **Self-assignment**: Pick tasks from "Todo" column during sprint planning
2. **Collaborative assignment**: Discuss complex tasks during meetings
3. **Workload balance**: Ensure equal distribution among team members
